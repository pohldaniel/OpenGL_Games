# leave spriteFilename, animationController, renderBlockSize, and imageColliderOffset empty if entity has no visuals. 
# entity can have a spriteFilename and a blank animationController if its just a non-animated image
# initialSpriteFrame indicates which subframe of the spriteFilename.eimg to start on. This will be ignored if spriteFilename is empty.
# if there is an animationController then a default/starting spriteFilename, localBounds, and renderBlockSize must be set
# Set localBounds mins > maxs if entity has no collision, if so then collisionActive and movementSpeed lines will be ignored. 
# Set movementSpeed to 0 to avoid allocating an eMovement.
