/// Cross-platform binary asset loader.
/// Cross-platform binary asset loader.  Requires files
/// to be located in a subdirectory of the application's source
/// tree named "assets" in order to be able to find them.  This
/// is enforced so that assets will be automatically packed into
/// the application's APK on Android (ANT defaults to packing the
/// tree under "assets" into the binary assets of the APK).
///
/// On platforms that use file trees for storage (Windows and
/// Linux), the search method for finding each file passed in as the
/// partial path <filepath> is as follows:
/// - Start at the application's current working directory
/// - Do up to 10 times:
///     -# For each search path <search> in the search list:
///          -# Try to open <currentdir>/<search>/<filepath>
///          -# If it is found, return it
///          -# Otherwise, move to next path in <search> and iterate
///     -# Change directory up one level and iterate
///
/// On Android, the file opened is always <filepath>, since the "assets"
/// directory is known (it is the APK's assets).
